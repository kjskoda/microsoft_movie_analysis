## Overview

We utilized our datasets to gather information on how much the production budget should be, which month is the best time to release, which genre is most viewed, and who the film should cater towards. 
Our data shows that you should release a PG-13 action/adventure film in July with a minimum production budget of $31 million and a target audience of ages 12 and up. 
We took a high level approach that focused mainly on the profitability and its effect on film success. By manipulating our domestic gross and production budget, we were able to create a new dataset--Profit--which provided us with better visualizations of which movies were most successful. We then used that data to observe which months grossed the most profit. With gross in mind, we found the top three genres that were most successful and compared their mean grosses with each month to ensure our original month observations matched. Once we had the genre and month, we found the most popular content rating to capture our target audience.  


## Business Problem


***
Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
***

## Data

Our datasets came from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB files, and B.O.M. Film Productions Co.
Each data set includes different columns of information that we merged, compared, and manipulated to pull out all data needed to solve our questions. 

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
